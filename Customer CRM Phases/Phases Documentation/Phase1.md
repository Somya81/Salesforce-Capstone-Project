# Customer Feedback CRM â€“ Complaint & Resolution Tracker

## Requirement Gathering
**Objective:** Enable companies to efficiently manage customer complaints and feedback, ensuring faster resolution, better tracking, and improved customer satisfaction.

### Functional Requirements
The system should be able to:
1. Allow customers to submit complaints and feedback through a form.
2. Log all complaints as records in the CRM.
3. Automatically assign complaints to the appropriate support team or agent.
4. Enable support team to update complaint status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Resolved).
5. Send notifications or alerts to support staff for pending complaints.
6. Allow managers to view dashboards showing complaint metrics like number of complaints, resolution time, and trends.
7. Generate simple reports on complaints and resolutions.

### Non-Functional Requirements
The system should ensure:
1. Easy-to-use interface for both customers and support staff.
2. Secure access with role-based permissions (Admins, Support, Customers).
3. Accessibility on desktop .

## Stakeholder Analysis

The key stakeholders are **customers, support team, managers/admins, and IT/admins**. Customers submit complaints, the support team resolves them, managers track metrics and generate reports, and IT/admins maintain the system. Understanding these stakeholders ensures the CRM meets user needs and improves efficiency.

## Business Process Mapping

The process begins with customers submitting complaints or feedback, which are logged in the CRM. The system automatically assigns complaints to the support team, who update the status as Pending, In Progress, or Resolved. Managers can monitor progress through dashboards and generate reports to track trends and resolution efficiency.
